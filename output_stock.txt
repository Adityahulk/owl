Do not attempt to solve the task by single step. You must instruct me to find the answer step by step.\nHere are some tips that will help you to give more valuable instructions about our task to me:\n<tips>\n- I have various tools to use, such as search toolkit, web browser simulation toolkit, document relevant toolkit, code execution toolkit, etc. Thus, You must think how human will solve the task step-by-step, and give me instructions just like that. For example, one may first use google search to get some initial information and the target url, then retrieve the content of the url, or do some web browser interaction to find the answer.\n- Although the task is complex, the answer does exist. If you can’t find the answer using the current scheme, try to re-plan and use other ways to find the answer, e.g. using other tools or methods that can achieve similar results.\n- Always remind me to verify my final answer about the overall task. This work can be done by using multiple tools(e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.), or something else.\n- If I have written code, please remind me to run the code and get the result.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- If the question mentions youtube video, in most cases you have to process the content of the mentioned video.\n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes (for example, the github content can be downloaded via https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...).\n- Flexibly write codes to solve some problems, such as excel relevant tasks.\n</tips>\n\nNow, here is the overall task: <task>Give me analysis of the tesla stock.

Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers.

The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- When trying to solve math problems, you can try to write python code and use sympy library to solve the problem.\n- Always verify the accuracy of your final answers! Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers.

Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates about Tesla stock to gather initial information and context.

Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates about Tesla stock to gather initial information and context.

Never flip roles! Never instruct me!

No need to verify your answer.. Never forget our task!\n\nI must instruct you based on your expertise and my needs to complete the task.

Here are some tips that may help you solve the task:\n<tips>\n- If one way fails to provide an answer, try other ways or methods. The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- When trying to solve math problems, you can try to write python code and use sympy library to solve the problem.\n- Always verify the accuracy of your final answers! Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates about Tesla stock to gather initial information and context.

No need to verify your answer.. Never forget our task!\n\nI must instruct you based on your expertise and my needs to complete the task.

Here are some tips that may help you solve the task:\n<tips>\n- If one way fails to provide an answer, try other ways or methods. The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- When trying to solve math problems, you can try to write python code and use sympy library to solve the problem.\n- Always verify the accuracy of your final answers! Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates about Tesla stock to gather initial information and context.

The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- When trying to solve math problems, you can try to write python code and use sympy library to solve the problem.\n- Always verify the accuracy of your final answers! Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates about Tesla stock to gather initial information and context.

Never flip roles! Never instruct me!

No need to verify your answer.. Never forget our task!\n\nI must instruct you based on your expertise and my needs to complete the task.

Here are some tips that may help you solve the task:\n<tips>\n- If one way fails to provide an answer, try other ways or methods. The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- When trying to solve math problems, you can try to write python code and use sympy library to solve the problem.\n- Always verify the accuracy of your final answers! Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates about Tesla stock to gather initial information and context.

No need to verify your answer.. Never forget our task!\n\nI must instruct you based on your expertise and my needs to complete the task.

Here are some tips that may help you solve the task:\n<tips>\n- If one way fails to provide an answer, try other ways or methods. The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- When trying to solve math problems, you can try to write python code and use sympy library to solve the problem.\n- Always verify the accuracy of your final answers! Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates about Tesla stock to gather initial information and context.

The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- When trying to solve math problems, you can try to write python code and use sympy library to solve the problem.\n- Always verify the accuracy of your final answers! Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates about Tesla stock to gather initial information and context.

(NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced fourth quarter and year end 2023 financial results. The results reflect continued progress against key value drivers including ramping production, improving cost efficiency, and driving demand through successfully introducing new technologies and enhancing the customer experience.\n\nProduction and manufacturing progress continued to improve throughout 2023. On a full-year basis, the company produced 57,232 vehicles and delivered 50,122, more than doubling production and deliveries from 2022, and exceeded its initial production guidance by more than 7,000 vehicles.\u202f\u202fAs expected, the fourth quarter of 2023 reflected greater discrepancy between production and deliveries when compared to prior quarters. Due to seasonality, EDV deliveries during the last quarter of each fiscal year are lower than previous quarters, while production remains continuous to maintain manufacturing efficiencies. Overall, there was a 147 percent increase in deliveries for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nThe company remains focused on cost efficiency, which has resulted in a meaningful improvement in operating efficiency\u202fin 2023, including a gross profit per delivered vehicle improvement of approximately $81,000, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nEconomic and geopolitical uncertainties and pressures, most notably the impact of historically high interest rates, have informed Rivian’s expectations for 2024. With these market conditions, the company expects to produce 57,000 vehicles in 2024, in line with 2023 production. For 2024, the company is guiding towards capital expenditures of $1,750 million and an Adjusted EBITDA\\* of $(2,700) million. Rivian will continue its company-wide cost transformation program, which to date has resulted in meaningful reductions in total unit costs for both the R1 and EDV models through engineering design changes, commercial cost downs, and manufacturing efficiencies. Today, Rivian also announced it is reducing its salaried workforce by approximately 10%.\n\nRivian continues to drive demand by developing future platforms and technologies while enhancing the customer experience. In 2024, Rivian will open new spaces and increase demodrives – bringing the Rivian experience to more cities and customers than ever before. Furthermore, on March 7th Rivian will reveal its midsize platform, the R2, for the first time.\n\n**RJ Scaringe, Founder and CEO, Rivian said**:\n\n“We made great progress in 2023 despite economic headwinds, and we’re excited about the year ahead. We firmly believe in the full electrification of the automotive industry, but recognize in the short-term, the challenging macro-economic conditions. We are aggressively focused on driving cost efficiency throughout the business, achieving positive margins and building our go-to-market function to support our long-term growth. We are excited about the reveal of our next generation vehicle, R2, on March 7.”\n\n**Financial Highlights:**\n\n**Revenue:**\n\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1,315 million, driven by the delivery of 13,972 vehicles.

The decreased Adjusted EBITDA\\* loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 was driven by lower gross profit losses.

These factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this press release. Any such forward-looking statements represent management’s estimates as of the date of this press release. While we may elect to update such forward-looking statements at some point in the future, except as may be required by law, we disclaim any obligation to do so, even if subsequent events cause our views to change.\n\n**\\*Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we review financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (“non-GAAP financial measures”). We believe our non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors, because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of each historical non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP is provided above. Reconciliations of forward- looking non-GAAP financial measures are not provided because we are unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and potential variability of, certain items, such as stock-based compensation expense and other costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted EBITDA defined as net loss before interest expense (income), net, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and other (expense) income, net.\n\n**About Rivian:**\n\nRivian exists to create products and services that help our planet transition to carbon neutral energy and transportation.

No need to verify your answer.. Never forget our task!\n\nI must instruct you based on your expertise and my needs to complete the task.

Here are some tips that may help you solve the task:\n<tips>\n- If one way fails to provide an answer, try other ways or methods. The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- When trying to solve math problems, you can try to write python code and use sympy library to solve the problem.\n- Always verify the accuracy of your final answers! Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates about Tesla stock to gather initial information and context.

(NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced fourth quarter and year end 2023 financial results. The results reflect continued progress against key value drivers including ramping production, improving cost efficiency, and driving demand through successfully introducing new technologies and enhancing the customer experience.\\n\\nProduction and manufacturing progress continued to improve throughout 2023. On a full-year basis, the company produced 57,232 vehicles and delivered 50,122, more than doubling production and deliveries from 2022, and exceeded its initial production guidance by more than 7,000 vehicles.\\u202f\\u202fAs expected, the fourth quarter of 2023 reflected greater discrepancy between production and deliveries when compared to prior quarters. Due to seasonality, EDV deliveries during the last quarter of each fiscal year are lower than previous quarters, while production remains continuous to maintain manufacturing efficiencies. Overall, there was a 147 percent increase in deliveries for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\\n\\nThe company remains focused on cost efficiency, which has resulted in a meaningful improvement in operating efficiency\\u202fin 2023, including a gross profit per delivered vehicle improvement of approximately $81,000, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.\\n\\nEconomic and geopolitical uncertainties and pressures, most notably the impact of historically high interest rates, have informed Rivian’s expectations for 2024. With these market conditions, the company expects to produce 57,000 vehicles in 2024, in line with 2023 production. For 2024, the company is guiding towards capital expenditures of $1,750 million and an Adjusted EBITDA\\\\* of $(2,700) million. Rivian will continue its company-wide cost transformation program, which to date has resulted in meaningful reductions in total unit costs for both the R1 and EDV models through engineering design changes, commercial cost downs, and manufacturing efficiencies.

We use the following non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors, because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of each historical non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP is provided above. Reconciliations of forward- looking non-GAAP financial measures are not provided because we are unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and potential variability of, certain items, such as stock-based compensation expense and other costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future.

No need to verify your answer.. Never forget our task!\n\nI must instruct you based on your expertise and my needs to complete the task.

Here are some tips that may help you solve the task:\n<tips>\n- If one way fails to provide an answer, try other ways or methods. The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- When trying to solve math problems, you can try to write python code and use sympy library to solve the problem.\n- Always verify the accuracy of your final answers! Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates about Tesla stock to gather initial information and context.

(NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced fourth quarter and year end 2023 financial results. The results reflect continued progress against key value drivers including ramping production, improving cost efficiency, and driving demand through successfully introducing new technologies and enhancing the customer experience.\\n\\nProduction and manufacturing progress continued to improve throughout 2023. On a full-year basis, the company produced 57,232 vehicles and delivered 50,122, more than doubling production and deliveries from 2022, and exceeded its initial production guidance by more than 7,000 vehicles.\\u202f\\u202fAs expected, the fourth quarter of 2023 reflected greater discrepancy between production and deliveries when compared to prior quarters. Due to seasonality, EDV deliveries during the last quarter of each fiscal year are lower than previous quarters, while production remains continuous to maintain manufacturing efficiencies. Overall, there was a 147 percent increase in deliveries for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\\n\\nThe company remains focused on cost efficiency, which has resulted in a meaningful improvement in operating efficiency\\u202fin 2023, including a gross profit per delivered vehicle improvement of approximately $81,000, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.\\n\\nEconomic and geopolitical uncertainties and pressures, most notably the impact of historically high interest rates, have informed Rivian’s expectations for 2024. With these market conditions, the company expects to produce 57,000 vehicles in 2024, in line with 2023 production. For 2024, the company is guiding towards capital expenditures of $1,750 million and an Adjusted EBITDA\\\\* of $(2,700) million. Rivian will continue its company-wide cost transformation program, which to date has resulted in meaningful reductions in total unit costs for both the R1 and EDV models through engineering design changes, commercial cost downs, and manufacturing efficiencies. Today, Rivian also announced it is reducing its salaried workforce by approximately 10%.\\n\\nRivian continues to drive demand by developing future platforms and technologies while enhancing the customer experience. In 2024, Rivian will open new spaces and increase demodrives – bringing the Rivian experience to more cities and customers than ever before. Furthermore, on March 7th Rivian will reveal its midsize platform, the R2, for the first time.\\n\\n**RJ Scaringe, Founder and CEO, Rivian said**:\\n\\n“We made great progress in 2023 despite economic headwinds, and we’re excited about the year ahead. We firmly believe in the full electrification of the automotive industry, but recognize in the short-term, the challenging macro-economic conditions. We are aggressively focused on driving cost efficiency throughout the business, achieving positive margins and building our go-to-market function to support our long-term growth. We are excited about the reveal of our next generation vehicle, R2, on March 7.”\\n\\n**Financial Highlights:**\\n\\n**Revenue:**\\n\\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1,315 million, driven by the delivery of 13,972 vehicles.

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions, including government closures of banks and liquidity concerns at other financial institutions, a potential global economic recession or other downturn and global conflicts or other geopolitical events; risks related to changes in overall demand for Lucid’s products and services and cancellation of reservations and orders for Lucid’s vehicles; risks related to prices and availability of commodities, Lucid’s supply chain, logistics, inventory management and quality control, and Lucid’s ability to complete the tooling of its manufacturing facilities over time and scale production of the Lucid Air and other vehicles; risks related to the uncertainty of Lucid’s projected financial information; risks related to the timing of expected business milestones and commercial product launches; risks related to the expansion of Lucid’s manufacturing facility, the construction of new manufacturing facilities and the increase of Lucid’s production capacity; Lucid’s ability to manage expenses and control costs; risks related to future market adoption of Lucid’s offerings; the effects of competition and the pace and depth of electric vehicle adoption generally on Lucid’s future business; changes in regulatory requirements, governmental incentives and fuel and energy prices; Lucid’s ability to rapidly innovate; Lucid’s ability to enter into or maintain partnerships with original equipment manufacturers, vendors and technology providers; Lucid’s ability to effectively manage its growth and recruit and retain key employees, including its chief executive officer and executive team; risks related to potential vehicle recalls and buybacks; Lucid’s ability to establish and expand its brand, and capture additional market share, and the risks associated with negative press or reputational harm; Lucid’s ability to effectively utilize or obtain certain credits and other incentives; Lucid’s ability to conduct equity, equity-linked or debt financings in the future; Lucid’s ability to pay interest and principal on its indebtedness; future changes to vehicle specifications which may impact performance, pricing and other expectations; the outcome of any potential litigation, government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries; and those factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of Lucid’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as well as in other documents Lucid has filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Lucid’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. If any of these risks materialize or Lucid’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Lucid currently does not know or that Lucid currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Lucid’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this communication. Lucid anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Lucid’s assessments to change. However, while Lucid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Lucid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Lucid’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this communication. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking\xa0statements.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Business Metrics**\n\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with US GAAP (“GAAP”) as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Lucid’s non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow which are discussed\xa0below.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss before (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) change in fair value of common stock warrant liability, (6) change in fair value of equity securities, (7) stock-based compensation, and (8) restructuring charges. Lucid believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to Lucid’s management and investors about Lucid’s financial performance. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. Lucid believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to Lucid’s management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital\xa0expenditures.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Lucid’s historical performance. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting, and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to Lucid’s investors regarding measures of our financial condition and results of operations that Lucid uses to run the business and therefore allows investors to better understand Lucid’s performance. However, these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under\xa0GAAP.\n\nNon-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under GAAP when understanding Lucid’s operating performance. In addition, other companies, including companies in Lucid’s industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Lucid’s non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is presented\xa0below.\n\n![Lucid Q4 2023 Chart](https://lucidmotors.com/s3fs-public/2024-02/q42023-chart1.webp)\n\n![Lucid Q4 2023 Chart](https://lucidmotors.com/s3fs-public/2024-02/q42023-chart2.webp)\n\n![Lucid Q4 2023 Chart](https://lucidmotors.com/s3fs-public/2024-02/q42023-chart3.webp)\n\n![Lucid Q4 2023 Chart](https://lucidmotors.com/s3fs-public/2024-02/q42023-chart4.webp)\n\n## Share\n\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flucidmotors.com%2Fmedia-room%2Flucid-q4-2023-financial-results)[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flucidmotors.com%2Fmedia-room%2Flucid-q4-2023-financial-results)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Flucidmotors.com%2Fmedia-room%2Flucid-q4-2023-financial-results&text=Lucid%20Motors)\n\n![Company Logo](https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dd23153e-c583-47e6-9054-4ed77b637cb4/0d605f01-2932-43ed-a20b-1fe6da2c871a/9e1d4c60-5819-407e-b8cb-2b25cd0f9a97/Logo-Lucid-light.png)\n\n## Cookie Management\n\nWhen you visit our website, we store cookies on your browser to collect information.

No need to verify your answer.. Never forget our task!\n\nI must instruct you based on your expertise and my needs to complete the task.

The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- When trying to solve math problems, you can try to write python code and use sympy library to solve the problem.\n- Always verify the accuracy of your final answers! Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates about Tesla stock to gather initial information and context.

(NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced fourth quarter and year end 2023 financial results. The results reflect continued progress against key value drivers including ramping production, improving cost efficiency, and driving demand through successfully introducing new technologies and enhancing the customer experience.\\n\\nProduction and manufacturing progress continued to improve throughout 2023. On a full-year basis, the company produced 57,232 vehicles and delivered 50,122, more than doubling production and deliveries from 2022, and exceeded its initial production guidance by more than 7,000 vehicles.\\u202f\\u202fAs expected, the fourth quarter of 2023 reflected greater discrepancy between production and deliveries when compared to prior quarters. Due to seasonality, EDV deliveries during the last quarter of each fiscal year are lower than previous quarters, while production remains continuous to maintain manufacturing efficiencies. Overall, there was a 147 percent increase in deliveries for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\\n\\nThe company remains focused on cost efficiency, which has resulted in a meaningful improvement in operating efficiency\\u202fin 2023, including a gross profit per delivered vehicle improvement of approximately $81,000, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.\\n\\nEconomic and geopolitical uncertainties and pressures, most notably the impact of historically high interest rates, have informed Rivian’s expectations for 2024. With these market conditions, the company expects to produce 57,000 vehicles in 2024, in line with 2023 production. For 2024, the company is guiding towards capital expenditures of $1,750 million and an Adjusted EBITDA\\\\* of $(2,700) million. Rivian will continue its company-wide cost transformation program, which to date has resulted in meaningful reductions in total unit costs for both the R1 and EDV models through engineering design changes, commercial cost downs, and manufacturing efficiencies. Today, Rivian also announced it is reducing its salaried workforce by approximately 10%.\\n\\nRivian continues to drive demand by developing future platforms and technologies while enhancing the customer experience. In 2024, Rivian will open new spaces and increase demodrives – bringing the Rivian experience to more cities and customers than ever before. Furthermore, on March 7th Rivian will reveal its midsize platform, the R2, for the first time.\\n\\n**RJ Scaringe, Founder and CEO, Rivian said**:\\n\\n“We made great progress in 2023 despite economic headwinds, and we’re excited about the year ahead. We firmly believe in the full electrification of the automotive industry, but recognize in the short-term, the challenging macro-economic conditions. We are aggressively focused on driving cost efficiency throughout the business, achieving positive margins and building our go-to-market function to support our long-term growth. We are excited about the reveal of our next generation vehicle, R2, on March 7.”\\n\\n**Financial Highlights:**\\n\\n**Revenue:**\\n\\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1,315 million, driven by the delivery of 13,972 vehicles. For the year end December\\xa031, 2023, total revenue was $4,434 million, supported by 50,122 total vehicle deliveries.

We believe our non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors, because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of each historical non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP is provided above. Reconciliations of forward- looking non-GAAP financial measures are not provided because we are unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and potential variability of, certain items, such as stock-based compensation expense and other costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\\n\\nOur non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted EBITDA defined as net loss before interest expense (income), net, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and other (expense) income, net.\\n\\n**About Rivian:**\\n\\nRivian exists to create products and services that help our planet transition to carbon neutral energy and transportation.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “will,” “shall,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target,” “continue,” “could,” “may,” “might,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict” or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding financial and operating outlook and guidance, future capital expenditures and other operating expenses, ability to control costs, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches, including the Lucid Gravity and Midsize platform, production and delivery volumes, expectations regarding market opportunities and demand for Lucid’s products, the range and performance of Lucid’s vehicles, plans and expectations regarding the Lucid Gravity, including performance, driving range, features, specifications, and Gravity’s potential impact on markets, plans and expectations regarding Lucid’s software, plans and expectations regarding Lucid’s systems approach to the design of the vehicles, plans and expectations regarding Lucid’s integration with North American Charging Standard, including timing and benefits, estimate of the length of time Lucid’s existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund planned operations, plans and expectations regarding its future capital raises and funding strategy, the timing of vehicle deliveries, plans and expectations regarding future manufacturing capabilities and facilities, studio and service center openings, ability to mitigate supply chain and logistics risks, plans and expectations regarding the Phase 2 expansion of Lucid’s AMP-1 factory, including potential benefits, ability to vertically integrate production processes, future sales channels and strategies, future market launches and international expansion, including plans and expectations for the AMP-2 manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia, plans and expectations regarding the purchase agreement with the government of Saudi Arabia, including the total number of vehicles that may be purchased under the agreement, expected order quantities, and the quantity and timing of vehicle deliveries, Lucid’s ability to grow its brand awareness, the potential success of Lucid’s direct-to-consumer sales strategy and future vehicle programs, potential automotive partnerships, including plans and expectations regarding Lucid’s strategic technology arrangement with Aston Martin, and the promise of Lucid’s technology.\\xa0These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this communication, and on the current expectations of Lucid’s management. These forward-looking statements are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and may differ from these forward-looking statements. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Lucid. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions, including government closures of banks and liquidity concerns at other financial institutions, a potential global economic recession or other downturn and global conflicts or other geopolitical events; risks related to changes in overall demand for Lucid’s products and services and cancellation of reservations and orders for Lucid’s vehicles; risks related to prices and availability of commodities, Lucid’s supply chain, logistics, inventory management and quality control, and Lucid’s ability to complete the tooling of its manufacturing facilities over time and scale production of the Lucid Air and other vehicles; risks related to the uncertainty of Lucid’s projected financial information; risks related to the timing of expected business milestones and commercial product launches; risks related to the expansion of Lucid’s manufacturing facility, the construction of new manufacturing facilities and the increase of Lucid’s production capacity; Lucid’s ability to manage expenses and control costs; risks related to future market adoption of Lucid’s offerings; the effects of competition and the pace and depth of electric vehicle adoption generally on Lucid’s future business; changes in regulatory requirements, governmental incentives and fuel and energy prices; Lucid’s ability to rapidly innovate; Lucid’s ability to enter into or maintain partnerships with original equipment manufacturers, vendors and technology providers; Lucid’s ability to effectively manage its growth and recruit and retain key employees, including its chief executive officer and executive team; risks related to potential vehicle recalls and buybacks; Lucid’s ability to establish and expand its brand, and capture additional market share, and the risks associated with negative press or reputational harm; Lucid’s ability to effectively utilize or obtain certain credits and other incentives; Lucid’s ability to conduct equity, equity-linked or debt financings in the future; Lucid’s ability to pay interest and principal on its indebtedness; future changes to vehicle specifications which may impact performance, pricing and other expectations; the outcome of any potential litigation, government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries; and those factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of Lucid’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as well as in other documents Lucid has filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Lucid’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. If any of these risks materialize or Lucid’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Lucid currently does not know or that Lucid currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Lucid’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this communication. Lucid anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Lucid’s assessments to change. However, while Lucid may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Lucid specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Lucid’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this communication. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking\\xa0statements.\\n\\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Business Metrics**\\n\\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with US GAAP (“GAAP”) as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Lucid’s non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow which are discussed\\xa0below.\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss before (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) change in fair value of common stock warrant liability, (6) change in fair value of equity securities, (7) stock-based compensation, and (8) restructuring charges. Lucid believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to Lucid’s management and investors about Lucid’s financial performance. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. Lucid believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to Lucid’s management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital\\xa0expenditures.\\n\\nThese non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Lucid’s historical performance. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting, and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to Lucid’s investors regarding measures of our financial condition and results of operations that Lucid uses to run the business and therefore allows investors to better understand Lucid’s performance. However, these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under\\xa0GAAP.\\n\\nNon-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under GAAP when understanding Lucid’s operating performance. In addition, other companies, including companies in Lucid’s industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Lucid’s non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is presented\\xa0below.\\n\\n![Lucid Q4 2023 Chart](https://lucidmotors.com/s3fs-public/2024-02/q42023-chart1.webp)\\n\\n![Lucid Q4 2023 Chart](https://lucidmotors.com/s3fs-public/2024-02/q42023-chart2.webp)\\n\\n![Lucid Q4 2023 Chart](https://lucidmotors.com/s3fs-public/2024-02/q42023-chart3.webp)\\n\\n![Lucid Q4 2023 Chart](https://lucidmotors.com/s3fs-public/2024-02/q42023-chart4.webp)\\n\\n## Share\\n\\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flucidmotors.com%2Fmedia-room%2Flucid-q4-2023-financial-results)[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flucidmotors.com%2Fmedia-room%2Flucid-q4-2023-financial-results)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Flucidmotors.com%2Fmedia-room%2Flucid-q4-2023-financial-results&text=Lucid%20Motors)\\n\\n![Company Logo](https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dd23153e-c583-47e6-9054-4ed77b637cb4/0d605f01-2932-43ed-a20b-1fe6da2c871a/9e1d4c60-5819-407e-b8cb-2b25cd0f9a97/Logo-Lucid-light.png)\\n\\n## Cookie Management\\n\\nWhen you visit our website, we store cookies on your browser to collect information.
