For example, one may first use google search to get some initial information and the target url, then retrieve the content of the url, or do some web browser interaction to find the answer.\n- Although the task is complex, the answer does exist. If you can’t find the answer using the current scheme, try to re-plan and use other ways to find the answer, e.g. using other tools or methods that can achieve similar results.\n- Always remind me to verify my final answer about the overall task. This work can be done by using multiple tools(e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.), or something else.\n- If I have written code, please remind me to run the code and get the result.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- If the question mentions youtube video, in most cases you have to process the content of the mentioned video.\n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes (for example, the github content can be downloaded via https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...).\n- Flexibly write codes to solve some problems, such as excel relevant tasks.\n</tips>\n\nNow, here is the overall task: <task>Give me analysis of the tesla stock.

Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates on Tesla stock to gather current information and trends.

 Solution: I used the DuckDuckGo search tool to find the latest news on Tesla stock and extracted content from Yahoo Finance. Here are some key points from the latest updates:

1. **Stock Performance**: Tesla shares have experienced significant fluctuations. They rose 3.4% recently, reaching their highest close since September 2023. However, the stock has also seen a decline of about 38% this year.

2. **Earnings and Deliveries**: Tesla's Q3 earnings showed unexpected growth, with a 9% rise. The company predicts slight vehicle delivery growth in 2024 compared to 2023's 1.8 million deliveries.

3. **Challenges**: Tesla has faced challenges, such as halting Cybertruck deliveries due to parts falling off. Additionally, there are concerns about demand, with some analysts issuing sell ratings.

4. **Market Sentiment**: Despite the stock's decline, some investors, like Cathie Wood, maintain high price targets for Tesla, citing its potential in the autonomous vehicle market.

5. **Strategic Moves**: Tesla is bringing back highly subsidized financing for new Model 3 orders, offering low annual percentage rates to boost sales.

These points provide a snapshot of Tesla's current stock situation, highlighting both opportunities and challenges the company faces.

However, the stock has also seen a decline of about 38% this year.\n\n2. **Earnings and Deliveries**: Tesla's Q3 earnings showed unexpected growth, with a 9% rise. The company predicts slight vehicle delivery growth in 2024 compared to 2023's 1.8 million deliveries.\n\n3. **Challenges**: Tesla has faced challenges, such as halting Cybertruck deliveries due to parts falling off. Additionally, there are concerns about demand, with some analysts issuing sell ratings.\n\n4. **Market Sentiment**: Despite the stock's decline, some investors, like Cathie Wood, maintain high price targets for Tesla, citing its potential in the autonomous vehicle market.\n\n5. **Strategic Moves**: Tesla is bringing back highly subsidized financing for new Model 3 orders, offering low annual percentage rates to boost sales.\n\nThese points provide a snapshot of Tesla's current stock situation, highlighting both opportunities and challenges the company faces.\n\n                Provide me with the next instruction and input (if needed) based on my response and our current task: <task>Give me analysis of the tesla stock.

The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- When trying to solve math problems, you can try to write python code and use sympy library to solve the problem.\n- Always verify the accuracy of your final answers! Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates on Tesla stock to gather current information and trends.

The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- When trying to solve math problems, you can try to write python code and use sympy library to solve the problem.\n- Always verify the accuracy of your final answers! Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates on Tesla stock to gather current information and trends.

Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates on Tesla stock to gather current information and trends.

You should return answer under 3 mins. No need to verify your answer.. Never forget our task!\n\nI must instruct you based on your expertise and my needs to complete the task.

Here are some tips that may help you solve the task:\n<tips>\n- If one way fails to provide an answer, try other ways or methods. The answer does exists.\n- If the search snippet is unhelpful but the URL comes from an authoritative source, try visit the website for more details.  \n- When looking for specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts), prioritize reliable sources and avoid relying only on search snippets.  \n- When solving tasks that require web searches, check Wikipedia first before exploring other websites.  \n- When trying to solve math problems, you can try to write python code and use sympy library to solve the problem.\n- Always verify the accuracy of your final answers! Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer. The right way is to think about the reason for the error and try again.\n- Search results typically do not provide precise answers. It is not likely to find the answer directly using search toolkit only, the search query should be concise and focuses on finding sources rather than direct answers, as it always need to use other tools to further process the url, e.g. interact with the webpage, extract webpage content, etc. \n- For downloading files, you can either use the web browser simulation toolkit or write codes.\n</tips>\n\n        '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Instruction: Start by searching for the latest news and updates on Tesla stock to gather current information and trends.

Try cross-checking the answers by other ways. (e.g., screenshots, webpage analysis, etc.).  \n- Do not be overly confident in your own knowledge. Searching can provide a broader perspective and help validate existing knowledge.  \n- After writing codes, do not forget to run the code and get the result. If it encounters an error, try to debug it.\n- When a tool fails to run, or the code does not run correctly, never assume that it returns the correct result and continue to reason based on the assumption, because the assumed result cannot lead you to the correct answer.
